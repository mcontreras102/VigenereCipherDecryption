# Vigenère Cipher

This project provides a program that allows users to encrypt and decrypt messages using the Vigenère cipher method.

## Features

- Encrypt messages by entering a message and a corresponding keyword.
- Decrypt already encrypted messages by providing the encrypted message and the key.
- Display the Vigenère table for reference.
- Menu-driven interface 

## Usage

1. Upon running the program, a menu will be displayed with the following options:
   - 1) Encrypt Message
   - 2) Decrypt Message
   - 3) Display Vigenère Table
   - 4) Exit the Program

2. Choose an option based on your requirements:
   - To encrypt a message, select option 1 and follow the prompts to enter the message and the key.
   - To decrypt a message, select option 2 and provide the encrypted message and the key.
   - Option 3 will display the Vigenère table, which can be used for reference.
   - Selecting option 4 will exit the program.

## Limitations

- The program assumes that the user will not enter messages containing spaces or special characters. Handling of such characters may result in unexpected behavior. Future improvements can be made by expanding the character set or implementing input validation to handle a wider range of inputs.
